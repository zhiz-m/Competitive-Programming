# Competitive-Programming
The .cpp files in this repository are all my own work, except for the file headers which have in part been inspired by other programmers. The quality of programming will also see some fluctuation, as all my competitive programming experience, including when I was a beginner, should be documented here. Some of my .cpp files are incomplete, but this represents a very small minority (should be less than a handful). The remaining files have all been submitted to online judging servers in the past (mostly Codeforces) and have been accepted.
